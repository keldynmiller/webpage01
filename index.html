<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Keldyn Miller and I am from Fort Collins, Colorado! I am a freshman here at Columbia and I am majoring graphic design. Below is a photo of one of my favorite places where I'm from, Rocky Mountain National Park, along with a link to a website where you can learn more about the park itself.</p>
